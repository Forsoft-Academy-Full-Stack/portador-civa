                    <p>It's about the future, isn't it? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. Don't tell me anything. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">Ah well, sort of. Thanks a lot, kid. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. What a nightmare.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-3">2. You have this thing hooked up to the car?</h2>
                    <p>Who is that guy. Yeah, I think maybe you do. What? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. Let's go.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something? Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is? Right. There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull? But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.</p>

It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees</p>

Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody.</p>
                    <h3>3.2.  I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Stop it. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott.</p>
